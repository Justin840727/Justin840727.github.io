                PEV (Persuasive Electric Vehicle) is a lightweight autonomous vehicle. It aims to solve urban mobility challenges with a healthy, convenient, sustainable alternative to cars. The PEV is low-cost, agile, and can be either an electrically-assisted tricycle for passenger commuting or an autonomous carrier for package delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been working on this project for four years (2016-2020) and helped develop it from a concept to launch. The system-level development can be separated into platform integration, autonomous system development, and professional prototyping three stages respectively. I am going to illustrate my work in each stage in later sections.

                        <p>
                            In this vehicle, we provide three different modes for user selection, including full manual, electric-assist, and full autonomous mode. My job is to create an interface that makes the in-vehicle computer able to switch in modes and control motors. In order to control the vehicle by ROS which usually controls the vehicle by linear and angular velocities, and converts the commands into each action of motors according to vehicle kinematics. Another function of this interface is the measurement of the encoder data from the back wheel and front steering motor and transforming data to odometry for state estimation.

                        <p>
                            To power up the sensors on the platform, I designed a simple power box that can charge batteries and convert voltage to 12V. Then I did a lot of experiments for different types of sensors, including 2D laser range finder, IMU, stereo camera, and RTK GPS. My first demo of the PEV project is curb following which extracts curb position from 2D Laser scan and uses PID controller to keep the distance between vehicle and curb.
